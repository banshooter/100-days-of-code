# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 18, 2019
##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: Write the greatest common divisor in Python.

**Thoughts:** Haven't learned much; just do easy coding practice.  Most of my time is spent on reading in this session.

### Day 1: May 19, 2019
##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: Write polynomial computation in Python

**Thoughts:** Take a lot of time to look up for Python syntax and features on Baidu(I live in China at the moment).  Learned to define class with __str__ as well as __eq__ methods.

### Day 2: May 20, 2019
##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: n-grams and try to check spell correction based on just n-grams(kinda failure with various reasons in mind)

**Thoughts:** Just coding n-grams after reading Speech and Language Processing Third Edition draft Daniel Jurafsky Stanford University.  What I learn is how to use http client as well as data structures in collections.

### Day 3: May 21, 2019
##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: Write in-place rotation of square matrix.

**Thoughts:** I was kinda lazy today so just did an algorithm practice.  What I learned is to do enum in Python as well as // floor_div operator.

### Day 4: May 22, 2019
##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: Write a simple calculator 

**Thoughts:** I did this one because of what I'd done with Java in my workplace just flashed into my brain.  I just wanna like those in python but only managed to do just basic calcuator within approximately one hour.

### Day 5: May 23, 2019
##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: N-queens

**Thoughts:** I spent almost all of my free time today watching computer class video.  I should practice coding so I come up with doing a stupid brute-force n-queens problem.

### Day 6: May 24, 2019
##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: Brute-force Sudoku

**Thoughts:** This just flashes into my mind.  I might learn something new in Python by solving this problem.  Today I learned variable scope in Python that you can assign variable declared outside function only if it's declared as global, so for function inside function this kind of assignment cannot be used.

### Day 7: May 25, 2019
##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: Write a python code to immitate what in the http://www.buildyourownlisp.com book. (to be continued)

**Thoughts:** It's Saturday but I managed to have time to read a good online book I'd like to read but haven't done so until now.  The reason I haven't read it because I think compiler is a subject that is just good to know but it's rarely been applicable at work.

### Day 8: May 26, 2019
##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: Write a python code to immitate what in the http://www.buildyourownlisp.com book finished chapter 7. (to be continued)

**Thoughts:** Completed what started yesterday and learn how to handle and exception in pyton in the process.

### Day 9: May 27, 2019
##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: Write a python code to immitate what in the http://www.buildyourownlisp.com book finished chapter 9. (to be continued)

**Thoughts:** Not much thought besides it would be easier if I change the way to tokenize this custom lisp syntax by split it with whitespace, but I will stick to the way I did.

### Day 10: May 28, 2019
##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: Write a python code to immitate what in the http://www.buildyourownlisp.com book finished chapter 10. (to be continued)

**Thoughts:** I should do more unit testing.

### Day 11: May 29, 2019
##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: Write a python code to immitate what in the http://www.buildyourownlisp.com book almost finished chapter 11. 

**Thoughts:** To not complete this `def` feature, I might be either misunderstood the `def` feature, or incorrectly implemented S and Q expression.  I've also read this book to chapter 12; I cannot think how to implemeent partial function feature.  I might need to read C code to see the implementation.

### Day 12: May 30, 2019
##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: Write a python code to immitate what in the http://www.buildyourownlisp.com book -- start chapter 12; in thinking and experiment process on how to implement lambda.

**Thoughts:** Today my brain was just like 10% of my usual.

### Day 13: May 31, 2019
##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: Write a python code to immitate what in the http://www.buildyourownlisp.com book.  Finish half of chapter 12.

**Thoughts:** Making lambda is easier than I thought, so my brain was kinda malfunction yesterday.  I have a problem on check equals of a Function class but could not figure it out why(TBD).

### Day 14: Jun 1, 2019
##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: Write a python code to immitate what in the http://www.buildyourownlisp.com book.  Refactor code and try to apply lazy evaluation on Q-Expression for the second half part of chapter 12(TBD).

**Thoughts:** Spending around an hour on weekend is tough.

### Day 15: Jun 2, 2019
##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: Write a python code to immitate what in the http://www.buildyourownlisp.com book.  Make q-expression to be lazy evaluated only the last section(Currying) of chapter 12 left.(TBD).

**Thoughts:** I need to pay debt of implement q-expression incorrectly and unit tests help me a lot of to change q-expression to be lazy evaluated.

### Day 16: Jun 3, 2019
##### To Learn Python 3 By Coding Practice

**Today's Progress**: Write a python code to immitate what in the http://www.buildyourownlisp.com book.  Finish chapter 12.(TBD).

**Thoughts:** I start to think if language is too dynamic, it would be really hard to read code.
